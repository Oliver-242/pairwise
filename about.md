Thanks for stopping by. My name is Jacek Czerwonka and I work for Microsoft. For a while now, in addition may day job, I have been involved in designing and implementing pairwise-related tools and evangelizing pairwise testing at Microsoft. This web site is a collection of links related to pairwise that I have accumulated in that period of time. I hope you find this information useful.

If you come across something that should be included here, have a comment, or simply want to chat about pairwise testing, email me.
